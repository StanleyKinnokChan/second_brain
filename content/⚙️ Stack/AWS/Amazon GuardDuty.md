<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Amazon GuardDuty** is a security monitoring service that analyzes and processesÂ [Foundational data sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_data-sources.html). It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IP addresses and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and malicious activity within your AWS environment. This can include issues like escalation of privileges, use of exposed credentials, or communication with malicious IP addresses, domains, presence of malware on your Amazon EC2 instances and container workloads, or discovery of unusual patterns of login events on your database.
