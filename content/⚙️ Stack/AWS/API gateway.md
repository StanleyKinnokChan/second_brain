- edge-optimized - routed to the nearest Cloudfront POP
- Regional - client in the same region
- private - only accessible only within a VPC via interface endpoint

**Stages**

- A stage is a named reference to a deployment, specific lifecycle stage or version of your API
- each stage has its o**wn endpoint URL and own settings**, which can be deployed individually
- provide isolation and testing
- stages enable for **canary deployment** (splits traffic between an already-deployed version and a new version, rolling it out to a subset of users before rolling out fully.)
- The canary can be promoted to make it the new base â€˜stagesâ€™
