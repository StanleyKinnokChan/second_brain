# Key Management Service (KMS)

**Overall**

- Regional & public service (every region is isolated)
- create, store and manage cryptographic keys (both symmetric & asymmetric)
- cryptographic operations on keys (encrypt, decryptâ€¦)
- KMS ensure **KMS keys never leave KMS** in a region for security purpose
    - provides **FIPS 140-2 (L2)** compliance service, which is a U.S. government computer security standard used to approve cryptographic modules
- can create alias to refer a key, but also regionally unique
- rotation is optional to customer-managed key but default in AWS-managed key
- every KMS key has a resource policies to explicitly trust a specific account
- IAM policies then grant right to user to use the key on certain resource

**KMS keys**

- logical keys contain ID, date, policy, desc & state
- backed by physical key material (the data held by KMS that used to encrypt and decrypt)
- generated by KMS or imported by you
- used for up to 4kb of data (small to generate other key)

**Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)**

- linked to KMS keys that created them
- two version
    - Plaintext version: use to encrypt the data then discard
    - Ciphertext/ encrypted version: give back to KMS for decrypt
