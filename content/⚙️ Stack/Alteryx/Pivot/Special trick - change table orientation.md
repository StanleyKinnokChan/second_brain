eg challenge 330

to change the table like this, we need to use both transpose and crosstab

we need to one more column (F1) because it will become the header in crosstab step

then in crosstab step,

group by name so that it become row of column

specific the column headers and value as our value in the tables (aggregation doesnâ€™t matter)
