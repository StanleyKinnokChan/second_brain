1. **Deploy a bastion host:**
Deploying a bastion host, also known as a jump server or a bastion server, is a common approach for accessing instances in a private subnet. It involves launching an additional EC2 instance in a public subnet and configuring SSH access to the bastion host. This option adds additional setup and maintenance overhead.
2. **Use EC2 Connect:**
EC2 Connect is a feature that simplifies SSH access to EC2 instances by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and the AWS Systems Manager service. It requires the instance to have a public IP or be accessible through a publicly accessible load balancer.
3. **Use an SSH connection with agent forwarding:**
This option involves establishing an SSH connection to an intermediate host (such as a bastion host) and then forwarding the SSH agent to the target instance. It requires the setup and management of SSH keys, and agent forwarding may not be ideal for security reasons.
4. **Session Manager**
It leverages the existing VPC endpoints and AWS Systems Manager capabilities to provide secure browser-based shell access to the EC2 instance without the need for a bastion host or SSH configuration.
