### About [this site](https://stanleykinnokchan.github.io/second_brain/):

This site serves as a repository for documenting my learning journey. I just recently discovered the concept of a [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) in March 2024. Consequently, the site may appear incomplete due to lack of documentation of older knowledge or messy formatted due to the incompatible export from other note system (e.g. picture link is not working). I plan to start documenting new information, and gradually integrate the older content as time allows.

Noted that my personal project or private life would not documented here.
