### ðŸ‘‹ Who am I?
I am Stanley Chan, a UK-based data consultant whose role oscillates between that of a data analyst and a data engineer. I specialize in delivering high-quality data projects to the companies I serve. As I enter my second year in this field, I have demonstrated a strong ability to learn and have received numerous positive feedback from both my company and clients. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest developments in the dynamic world of data technology.

Up to now, I have earned the following official badges: [[My badges]]

### About this site
This site serves as a repository for documenting my learning journey. I just recently discovered the concept of a [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) in March 2024. Consequently, the site may appear incomplete due to lack of documentation of older knowledge or messy formatted due to the incompatible export from other note system (e.g. picture link is not working). I plan to start documenting new information, and gradually integrate the older content as time allows.

Noted that my personal project or private life would not documented here.
