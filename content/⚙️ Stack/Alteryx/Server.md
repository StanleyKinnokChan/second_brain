# Server

- **Collection:** A collection in Alteryx Server is a container that groups related assets such as workflows, macros, and data connections. Collections can be used to organize content by project, team, or department. They can also be used to control access to content by setting permissions at the collection level. Collections can be created and managed by administrators or users with the appropriate permissions.
- **Subscription:** A subscription in Alteryx Server allows users to receive updates when changes are made to specific content. Users can subscribe to collections, workflows, and other assets. When changes are made to a subscribed item, users receive notifications via email or in the Alteryx Gallery. Subscriptions can be managed by individual users.
- **District:** A district in Alteryx Server is a group of Alteryx Server nodes that are configured to work together to manage content and processes. Districts are typically used in larger installations where multiple nodes are required to support high volumes of users and content. Districts can be managed by administrators and are used to configure settings such as load balancing, failover, and security.
