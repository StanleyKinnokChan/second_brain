- certificates prove identity, which is provided by a trusted authority by identifying DNS name

- ACM lets you run a public or private certificate authority (CA)
    - **public CA** - browsers trust a list of providers, which can trust other providers
    - **private CA** - applications need to trust your private CA, adding policy to configure the trust
- ACM can generate or import cert.
    - **if generatedâ€¦it can automatically renew**
    - **if importedâ€¦you are responsible for renewal**
- **cert can be deployed out, to supported AWS services only (cloudfront & ALBsâ€¦not EC2)**
- ACM is a **regional service**, **cert cannot leave** the region they are generated or imported in
    - where you need cert, generate/import the cert in there
    - for global services, operate as though within â€˜us-east-1â€™
