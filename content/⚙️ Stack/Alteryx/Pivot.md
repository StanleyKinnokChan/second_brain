# Pivot

- **Transpose configuration**
    - **key column:** each value in this column will be duplicated by the number of data column
    - **data column:** all column collapse into the one
- **Crosstab configuration**
    - **group:** representing the row in the transformed dataset, needed when multiple columns are wanted
    - **header: measures that become headers,** not necessary important but required
    - **value:** aggregated when multiple values correspond to same measure
    - **aggregation method:** not important when we just change the orientation of table, or no multiple values correspond to same measure


[[Special trick - change table orientation]]
