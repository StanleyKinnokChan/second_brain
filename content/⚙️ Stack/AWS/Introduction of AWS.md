# Introduction of AWS

[[Concept of tools and services]]

- **Service covered**
    - compute
    - storage
    - databases
    - analytics
    - networking
    - mobile
    - developer tools
    - management tools
    - IoT
    - security
    - Enterprise apps
- **benefits of AWS**
    - agility
    - elasticity (scale up and down dependent on demand)
    - cost-saving (no up-front cost)
    - deploy globally in minutes
- **What is a client-server model?**

    In computing, a **client** can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests with permission to computer servers. A **server** can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.
    For example, suppose that a client makes a request for a news article, the score in an online game, or a funny video. The server evaluates the details of this request and fulfills it by returning the information to the client.

- **The 7 R’s of common practice for migration**
    1. Rehost

        [[recreating the on-premise network, just change the host on AWS]]

        - Automating with tools such as AWS Application Migration Service
    2. Replatform

        [[Introduction of AWS/Untitled 1.png]]

        - involves modifying legacy software to perform better in the cloud
        - like rehosting retaining the core architecture
        - Marking targeted AWS cloud optimizations
    3. Relocate

        [[Introduction of AWS/Untitled 2.png]]

        - like rehosting but on hypervisor level
        - specific to VMware cloud on AWS
    4. Refactor

    [[Introduction of AWS/Untitled 3.png]]

    1. Retire
        - shutting off non-useful applications
        - reducing spend, management, and securtiy
    2. Retain/ revisit
        - keeping certain applications on-premises
    3. Repurchase
        - moving workflows to SaaS

- **Cloud Architecture Best Practices**
    1. Design for failure and nothing fails

        [[Introduction of AWS/Untitled 4.png]]

    2. Build security in every layer

        [[Introduction of AWS/Untitled 5.png]]

    3. Leverage different storage options

        [[Introduction of AWS/Untitled 6.png]]

    4. Implement elasticity

        [[Introduction of AWS/Untitled 7.png]]

    5. Think parallel

    6. Loose coupling sets you free

    7. Don’t fear constraints

- **6-pillars Well-Architected framework**
    1. Operational Excellence
    2. Security
    3. Reliability
    4. Performance Efficiency
    5. Cost Optimization
    6. Sustainability
- **Migration process**

    [[Introduction of AWS/Untitled 11.png]]

    - adopt a Minimum viable product (MVP) to allow customers to see how to process. Start with basics and keep receiving feedback

- **Modernization**
    - benefit
        - significantly reduce TCO (total cost of ownership) for cost optimization
        - gain ability through automation
        - free up resources to drive innovation
    - Containers

    - Serverless
