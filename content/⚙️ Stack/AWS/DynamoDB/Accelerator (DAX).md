- install DAX SDK in the application and it handles all the caches and data retrieval
- DAX caches data within VPCs
- less complexity without admin overhead - application no need to communicate with dynamoDB

**Architecture**

- primary node (writes) & replicas (read)
- **in-memory cache** - great for scaling & speed
- **scale up** and **scale out** easily
- support **write-through**
- **DAX deployed** within a VPC, so application should be inside the VPC
