- reduce script silos
- Remove the need of avoiding writing boilerplate DML and DDL
- Test and doc at the same time
- dynamic referencing/ (Write DRYer code by leveraging macros, hooks, and package management) parameterization
- DAG for modelling the whole transformation process
- maintain idempotency
- adopt versioning/ CI/CD practice, integrated with Git
- dry code (but be aware of readability! Too many macro/ small component are very difficult to undertsand )

Incoperated with pythonic template language Jinja - foundation of referening and macro
