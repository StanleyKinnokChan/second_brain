The table above is not a cross tab, but a list of columns with a dummy in-field calculation 1, of which the mark cards are all set to circle with 0% of size and opacity.

Using 1 will create a centered alignment

if we need to show a icon side by side the text label, or space for text display, we need to use 0.1 instead of 1, and fixed the axis from 0 to 1. This practice can push the icon to the left so that we can change the alignment of the text label as right to the icon.

The same applied to the right text alignment by using 1.0 instead of 1, shown in the 3rd column with the location info neatly right-aligned.
